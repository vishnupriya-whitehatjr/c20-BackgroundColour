How does Map work???

Map is used to change or remap a particular number. 
As we need different numbers which will lead to various (r,b,g) combinations. 
We used this method to gerenate remapped numbers for r,b,g so that we can change the background colours.

Map() :

      Syntax: map(value, start1, stop1, start2, stop2, [withinBounds])
      
      Parameters:
          
          value Number: the incoming value to be converted
          start1 Number: lower bound of the value's current range
          stop1 Number: upper bound of the value's current range
          start2 Number: lower bound of the value's target range
          stop2 Number: upper bound of the value's target range
          withinBounds Boolean: constrain the value to the newly mapped range (Optional)
  
      Reference Examples : 
  
            function setup() {
              noStroke();
            }

            function draw() {
              background(204);
              let x1 = map(mouseX, 0, width, 25, 75);
              ellipse(x1, 25, 25, 25);
              //This ellipse is constrained to the 0-100 range
              //after setting withinBounds to true
              let x2 = map(mouseX, 0, width, 0, 100, true);
              ellipse(x2, 75, 25, 25);
            }
